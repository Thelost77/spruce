# spruce

A terminal music client for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/). Browse albums and
playlists, build a queue, and control playback without leaving the terminal.

Spruce uses [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for the
interface and [mpv](https://mpv.io/) for audio playback.

## Features

- Browse albums and tracks across Jellyfin music libraries
- Browse Jellyfin playlists
- Play individual tracks or queue whole albums and playlists
- Shuffle, repeat, filter, remove, and jump within the playback queue
- Fuzzy command-palette search across loaded albums, playlists, and tracks
- Edit album and track metadata
- Report playback state and progress to Jellyfin
- MPRIS media controls through the D-Bus session bus
- Configurable playback speed, seek interval, keybindings, and colors
- Sleep timer and automatic mpv process cleanup

## Requirements

- Go 1.26.4 or newer for source installation
- `mpv` installed and available in `PATH`
- A Jellyfin account with at least one music library
- A Unix-like operating system

Linux is the primary platform. macOS cross-compiles, but MPRIS requires a D-Bus
session and is primarily useful on Linux. Windows is not currently supported.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/Thelost77/spruce@latest
```

Ensure the Go binary directory, normally `~/go/bin`, is in `PATH`.

To build the current checkout:

```sh
go build -o spruce .
```

## Usage

```sh
spruce
spruce --version
```

The first run opens the login screen. Enter the Jellyfin server address,
username, and password. If the address has no scheme, Spruce uses `http://`.

After a successful login, Spruce stores the server address, username, user ID,
access token, and stable device identity in the operating system's Spruce config
directory. On Linux this is normally `~/.config/spruce/config.toml`.

The access token is stored as plaintext. The config directory uses mode `0700`
and the file uses mode `0600`; local file permissions are the security boundary.
See [Auth token storage](docs/design/auth-token-storage.md) for the decision and
operational details.

Logs are written to the same config directory as `spruce.log` and rotated after
5 MB.

## Common keybindings

Keys can be context-specific. Press `?` in Spruce for the complete active help.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` | Quit |
| `esc` / `←` | Go back or clear an active filter |
| `enter` / `→` | Open or select |
| `j` / `k` | Move down or up |
| `/` | Filter the current list |
| `space` | Play or pause |
| `h` / `l` | Seek backward or forward |
| `n` / `>` | Next track |
| `N` / `p` / `<` | Previous track |
| `a` / `A` | Add selected track or collection to the queue |
| `S` | Shuffle selected collection or cycle the sleep timer |
| `s` | Shuffle the current queue |
| `r` / `R` | Repeat current track or queue |
| `+` / `-` | Increase or decrease playback speed |
| `]` / `[` | Increase or decrease volume |
| `m` | Edit selected album or track metadata |
| `t` | Toggle album-order/title track sorting |
| `o` | Open playlists |
| `tab` | Switch between content and queue |
| `ctrl+p` | Open the command palette |
| `?` | Toggle help |

## Configuration

Spruce writes all defaults to `config.toml` after the first successful login.
Common editable settings include:

```toml
[player]
speed = 1.0
seek_seconds = 10

[keybinds]
quit = "q"
play_pause = " "
seek_forward = "l"
seek_backward = "h"
next_track = "n"
prev_track = "N"
speed_up = "+"
speed_down = "-"
volume_up = "]"
volume_down = "["
sleep_timer = "S"
back = "esc"
```

The generated `[theme]` section contains the editable Everforest color values.
See [Theme configuration](docs/design/theme-configuration.md) for the supported
scope.

Jellyfin identifies each Spruce installation through `server.device_id`. Keep
that value stable on one installation. Remove it when copying the config to a
different machine so Spruce generates a separate identity.

## Development

```sh
go mod verify
go test ./... -count=1
go test -race ./... -count=1
go vet ./...
go build ./...
```

Main packages:

```text
main.go             process startup and shutdown
internal/app/       root model, navigation, queue, playback lifecycle
internal/jellyfin/  Jellyfin API client and data types
internal/mpris/     D-Bus MPRIS adapter and bridge
internal/player/    mpv process and IPC control
internal/screens/   login, library, playlist, queue, metadata editor
internal/ui/        shared styles and components
```

## Releases

Spruce uses SemVer tags with a leading `v`. Release notes live in
`docs/releases/`. Commit and push the notes and all release changes to `main`,
then run:

```sh
./scripts/release.sh v0.1.0
```

The script verifies the repository, creates and pushes the exact annotated tag,
and publishes a GitHub Release. It can safely retry release creation after a
partial failure.
